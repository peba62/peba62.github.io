    <h1>MELIA</h1>
<p>MELIA is a theorem prover for the Model Evolution Calculus with Equality
and built-in linear integer arithmetic.

<p>MELIA accepts formulas in the TPTP FOF, TFF, and TFF-INT formats (see
<a href="http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/TPTP/TR/TPTPTR.shtml">the TPTP
technical report</a>). It includes a 
pre-processor for transforming such formulas into (sorted) constrained
clauses, as prescribed by the calculus. MELIA features a variety of flag
settings to control its search, e.g., for selecting literals to focus
inferences on.

<p>MELIA has been written from scratch in <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>
and runs on the Java virtual machine. It is in a very early stage of
development and has not been tuned for performance.  When integer arithmetic
is involved, MELIA is incomplete even if theoretically unneccessary.
These issues will be addressed in forthcoming releases.
