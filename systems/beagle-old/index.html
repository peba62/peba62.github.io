<h2>Beagle - a theorem prover for hierarchic superposition with weak abstraction</h2>
<p>Beagle is an automated theorem prover for first-order logic with equality over
linear integer arithmetic. It accepts formulas in the FOF, TFF, and
TFA formats of the 
<a href="http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/TPTP/TR/TPTPTR.shtml">TPTP</a> syntax.  

<ul>
<li><a href="README.txt">README.txt</a>, with further information and
installation instructions.
<li><a href="beagle-0.4.tgz">beagle-0.4.tgz</a>, a compressed
tar archive containing the Scala sources. <br><br>
    Update 06/06/2013: Version 0.4.1: be more cautious about reporting
    "Satisfiable" or "CounterSatisfiable". In the fixed version, 
    a saturated state not containing the empty clause is reported as
    "Satisfiable" or "CounterSatisfiable" only if no background theories are
    present, otherwise it is "Unknown". (This could be sharpened.)

a Java RTE 1.6.

beagle and on (by now obsolete) experimental results.
