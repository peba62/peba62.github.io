<a name="background">
<H3>Background</H3>
</a>
<p>
The arguably most successful branch of automated reasoning today is
(propositional) SAT solving. Propositional encodings and SAT solvers
are widely used in AI and formal methods to solve problems from
planning, diagnosis, knowledge compilation, constraint satisfaction,
just to name a few, and they dominate the whole area of software and
hardware verification for embedded reasoning services. However, while
the success of <em>reducing</em> problems to propositional logic is
undeniable, many problems are more naturally formulated in a more
expressive logic. For instance, constraint satisfaction problems,
bounded model checking and bit-vector arithmetic problems can often be
encoded more succinctly in a restricted fragment of first-order, EPR
(Essentially Propositional Reasoning, equivalent to the
Bernays-Schönfinkel class). Instance-based methods for first-order
logic, which natively
decide EPR in a non-trivial way, can then be 
considered for beneficial use in problem formulation and reasoning.
Similarly, Description Logics are widely used as logical underpinning  
of ontology languages such as OWL, which has led to the design and  
investigations of a number of interesting reasoning approaches and  
novel reasoning problems. 


<a name="topic">
<H3>Workshop Topic</H3>
</a>
<p>
This workshop is centered around the question whether (fragments of)
logics more expressive than propositional logic, in particular
first-order logic, can <em>directly</em> be
used for problem formulation and 
reasoning in the areas that are dominated by propositional methods
today. This question becomes non-trivial under the conditions that the
use of these logics shall address shortcomings of the
propositional approach, such as lack of expressivity and scalability,
while not compromising efficiency. We perceive this as a long-term
research challenge.

<p>
The workshop solicits contributions towards this challenge. 
The topic list includes (but is not limited to) the following: 

<ul>
<li> Innovative encodings of application problems in AI and formal
  methods into logics more expressive than propositional logic
<li> Problem solving with EPR: reductions from e.g. planning, bounded model
  checking, QBF, description and modal logics into EPR;
  calculi and systems for EPR and extensions like theory reasoning,
  equality
<li> Finite model finders, in particular based on encodings into tractable
  fragments of first-order logic
<li> Transfer of techniques developed for propositional SAT or for
  constraint satisfaction to theorem provers for more expressive
  logics 
<li> Implementation techniques and implementations
<li> Practical applications and reports on success/failure of
  first-order methods
<li>EPR Benchmark problems (the TPTP doesn't have enough)
  </ul>

<a name="submission">
<h3>Submission</h3>
</a>
<p>There are two submission categories:
<ul>
<li><b>Previously unpublished work.</b><br>
  Beside mature work, we also solicit preliminary work or work in
  progress. Submissions should not exceed 15 printed pages.
  The final versions of the selected contributions will be collected in
  the workshop proceedings.

<li><b>Presentation-only papers of previously published work.</b><br>
  The intent of presentation-only papers is to allow authors to
  make their recently published work known to a wider audience.
  Participants who wish to submit in this category should
  provide a summary of up to 3 pages and an indication where
  the paper has appeared, or is expected to appear. 
  The abstracts of the presentation-only papers will be included
  in the workshop proceedings, but the papers themselves will not be
  included. 
  </ul>

<p>
<em>Submission is electronic only</em>,
through <a href="http://www.easychair.org/">EasyChair</a>.
To submit, please go to <a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=beyondsat09">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=beyondsat09</a>.

<h3>Publication</h3>
</a>
<p>The (informal) workshop proceedings will be distributed at the
workshop and made available on the internet.
