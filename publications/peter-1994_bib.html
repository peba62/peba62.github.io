		  a problem domain into a deduction system or calculus, such
		  as model elimination. We present several complete versions
		  of highly restricted theory model elimination (TME)
		  calculi. These restrictions allow (1) to keep fewer path
		  literals in extension steps than in related calculi, and
		  (2) to discard proof attempts with multiple occurrences of
		  literals along a path (i.e.\ regularity holds). On the
		  other hand, we obtain by small modifications to TME
		  versions which do not need contrapositives ({\`a} la
		  Near-Horn Prolog). We show how regularity can be adapted
		  for these versions. The {\em independence of the goal
		  computation rule\/} holds for all variants. Comparative
		  runtime results for our PTTP-implementations are supplied.},
