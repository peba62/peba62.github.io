<blockquote><font size="-1">
The paper introduces a knowledge representation language that
combines Kowalski's event calculus with description logic in a
logic programming framework. The purpose is to provide the user
with an expressive language for modelling and analysing systems
that evolve over time. The description logic component is
intended for modelling structural properties, the event calculus
for actions and their consequences, and the logic programming
rules for their integration and other aspects, such as diagnosis.
By means of an elaborated example, the paper demonstrate the
interplay of these three components for computing possible models
as plausible explanations of the current state of the modelled
system. The approach is prototypically implemented in our logic
programming system Fusemate. The paper first extends Fusemate's
rule language with a weakly DL-safe interface to the description
logic ALCIF (which is implemented in Fusemate itself). It then
embeds a suitable version of the event calculus, and provides
rules as the &ldquo;glue&rdquo; between these components.
