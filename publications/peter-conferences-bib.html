  ABSTRACT = {In the era of information technology, providing high
  quality and state of the art educational material is quite a
  challenge and requires the use of new media. The In2Math project at
  the University of Koblenz-Landau develops in this context the {\em
  Living Book\/}; Living Book means personalized user oriented
  educational material together with interactive components. The
  Living Book aims at supporting the fundamental parts of
  undergraduate classes in theoretical computer science.  The main
  goal is to support the active, explorative and self-determined
  learning in lectures, tutorials and selfstudy.  \par This paper
  describes the main aspects of the Living Book and explains the
  concepts and ideas behind it as well as the techniques used to
  realized these concepts. }

  ABSTRACT = {The DPLL procedure, due to Davis, Putnam,
	    Logemann, and Loveland, is the basis of some of
	    the most successful propositional satisfiability
	    solvers to date.  Although originally devised as a
	    proof-procedure for first-order logic, it has been
	    used almost exclusively for propositional logic so
	    far because of its highly inefficient treatment of
	    quantifiers, based on instantiation into ground
	    formulas.
	    \par
	    The recent FDPLL calculus by Baumgartner was the
	    first successful attempt to lift the procedure to
	    the first-order level without recurring to ground
	    instantiations.  FDPLL lifts to the first-order
	    case the core of the DPLL procedure, the splitting
	    rule, but ignores other aspects of the procedure
	    that, although not necessary for completeness, are
	    crucial for its effectiveness in practice.  
	    \par
	    In this paper, we present a new calculus loosely
	    based on FDPLL that lifts these aspects as well.
	    In addition to being a more faithful litfing of
	    the DPLL procedure, the new calculus contains a
	    more systematic treatment of {\em universal literals\/},
	    one of FDPLL's optimizations, and so has the
	    potential of leading to much faster
	    implementations.}

  ABSTRACT = {FDPLL is a directly lifted version of the well-known
  Davis-Putnam-Logeman-Loveland (DPLL) procedure.  While DPLL is based
  on a splitting rule for case analysis wrt.\ ground and complementary
  literals, FDPLL uses a lifted splitting rule, i.e.\ the case
  analysis is made wrt.\ non-ground and complementary literals now.
  \par
  The motivation for this lifting is to bring together successful first-order
  techniques like unification and subsumption to the propositionally
  successful DPLL procedure.
  \par
  At the heart of the method is a new technique to represent
  first-order interpretations, where a literal specifies truth values
  for all its ground instances, unless there is a more specific
  literal specifying opposite truth values.  Based on this idea, the
  FDPLL calculus is developed and proven as
  strongly complete.}

		  affine logic (i.e. clauses with xor as the connective) and
		  cannot be efficiently (if at all) solved by using CNF-only
		  provers. \par We present a decision procedure to
		  efficiently decide such problems. The Gauss-DPLL procedure
		  is a tight integration in a unifying framework of a
		  Gauss-Elimination procedure (for affine logic) and a
		  Davis-Putnam-Logeman-Loveland procedure (for usual clause
		  logic). \par The key idea, which distinguishes our approach
		  from others, is the full interaction bewteen the two parts
		  which makes it possible to maximise (deterministic)
		  simplification rules by passing around newly created unit
		  or binary clauses in either of these parts. We show the
		  correcteness and the termination of Gauss-DPLL under very

		  K{\"u}h97] with a clause transformation turning the
		  abductive task into a model generation problem and show the
		  completeness of this transformation with respect to the

  for minimal model computation developed within the hyper tableau
  framework. This combination generalizes well-known
  tableaux techniques like complement splitting and folding-up/down. 
  We argue that this
  combination allows for efficiency improvements over previous, related
  methods. It is motivated by application to diagnosis tasks; in
  particular the problem of avoiding redundancies in the diagnoses of
  electrical circuits with reconvergent fanouts is addressed by the
  new technique. In

  a sound and complete calculus for  propositional circumscriptive
  reasoning in the presence of minimized and varying predicates.

  ABSTRACT = { We present modifications of model elimination which do
		  not necessitate the use of contrapositives. These restart
		  model elimination calculi are proven sound and complete.
		  The corresponding proof procedures are evaluated by a
		  number of runtime experiments and they are compared to
		  other well known provers. Finally we relate our results to
		  other calculi, namely the connection method, modified
		  problem reduction format and Near-Horn Prolog. }

  ABSTRACT = {In this paper we present an ordered theory resolution
		  calculus and prove its completeness. Theory reasoning means
		  to relieve a calculus from explicitly drawing inferences in
		  a given theory by special purpose inference rules (e.g.
		  E-resolution for equality reasoning). We take advantage of
		  orderings (e.g. simplification orderings) by disallowing to
		  resolve upon clauses which violate certain maximality
		  constraints; stated positively, a resolvent may only be
		  built if all the selected literals are maximal in their
		  clauses. By this technique the search space is drastically
		  pruned. As an instantiation for theory reasoning we show
		  that equality can be built in by rigid E-unification. }

		  logic. We show how to extend this calculus with a framework
		  for {\em theory reasoning}. Theory reasoning means to
		  separate the knowledge of a given domain or theory and
		  treat it by special purpose inference rules. We present two
		  versions of theory model elimination: the one is called
		  {\em total theory model elimination} (which allows e.g. to
		  treat equality in a rigid E-resolution style), and the
		  other is called {\em partial theory model elimination}
		  (which allows e.g. to treat equality in a paramodulation
		  style). }

		  The advantages of this approach are, for the first, its
