  ABSTRACT = {The Living Book is a system for the management of
personalized and scenario specific teaching material. The main goal of
the system is to support the active, explorative and self-determined
learning in lectures, tutorials and self study. The Living Book
includes a course on 'logic for computer scientists' with a uniform
access to various tools like theorem provers and an interactive
tableau editor. It is routinely used within teaching undergraduate
courses at our university.
\par
This paper describes the Living Book and the use of theorem proving
technology as a core component in the knowledge management system
(KMS) of the Living Book.  The KMS provides a {\em scenario
  management\/} component where teachers may describe those parts of
given documents that are relevant in order to achieve a certain
learning goal. The task of the KMS is to assemble new documents from a
database of elementary units called 'slices' (definitions, theorems,
and so on) in a scenario-based way (like 'I want to prepare for an
exam and need to learn about resolution').
\par
The computation of such assemblies is carried out by a
model-generating theorem prover for first-order logic with a default
negation principle. Its input consists of meta data that describe the
dependencies between different slices, and logic-programming style
rules that describe the scenario-specific composition of slices.
Additionally, a user model is taken into account that contains
information about topics and slices that are known or unknown to a
student. A model computed by the system for such input then directly
specifies the document to be assembled.
\par
This paper introduces the e-learning context we are faced with,
motivates our choice of logic and presents the newly developed
calculus used in the KMS.}

  ABSTRACT = {The DPLL procedure, due to Davis, Putnam,
	    Logemann, and Loveland, is the basis of some of
	    the most successful propositional satisfiability
	    solvers to date.  Although originally devised as a
	    proof-procedure for first-order logic, it has been
	    used almost exclusively for propositional logic so
	    far because of its highly inefficient treatment of
	    quantifiers, based on instantiation into ground
	    formulas.
	    \par
	    The recent FDPLL calculus by Baumgartner was the
	    first successful attempt to lift the procedure to
	    the first-order level without recurring to ground
	    instantiations.  FDPLL lifts to the first-order
	    case the core of the DPLL procedure, the splitting
	    rule, but ignores other aspects of the procedure
	    that, although not necessary for completeness, are
	    crucial for its effectiveness in practice.  
	    \par
	    In this paper, we present a new calculus loosely
	    based on FDPLL that lifts these aspects as well.
	    In addition to being a more faithful litfing of
	    the DPLL procedure, the new calculus contains a
	    more systematic treatment of {\em universal literals\/},
	    one of FDPLL's optimizations, and so has the
	    potential of leading to much faster
	    implementations.}

  ABSTRACT = { The Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland procedure (DPLL) was
		  introduced in the early 60s as a proof procedure for
		  first-order logic. Nowadays, only its propositional logic
		  core component is widely used in efficient propositional
		  logic provers and respective applications. This success
		  motivates to reconsider lifting DPLL to the first-order
		  logic level in a more contemporary way, by exploiting
		  successful first-order techniques like ``unification''.
		  Following this idea, in this paper a first-order logic
		  version of DPLL, FDPLL, is presented. \par While
		  propositional DPLL is based on a splitting rule for case
		  analysis wrt.\  ground and complementary literals, FDPLL
		  uses a lifted splitting rule, i.e.\  the case analysis is
		  made wrt.\ non-ground and complementary literals now. To
		  make this work, a new way of treating variables is
		  employed. It comes together with a compact way of
		  representing and reasoning with first-order logic
		  interpretations, much like propositional DPLL reasons about
		  propositional truth assignments. As a nice consequence,
		  FDPLL naturally decides the class of
		  Bernays-Sch{\"o}nfinkel formulas, which is notoriously
		  difficult for most other calculi.}

		  automated deduction. The application is the management of
		  documents (such as mathematical textbooks) as they occur in
		  a readily available tool. In this ``Slicing Information
		  Technology tool'', documents are decomposed (``sliced'')
		  into small units. A particular application task is to
		  assemble a new document from such units in a selective way,
		  based on the user's current interest and knowledge. \par It
		  is argued that this task can be naturally expressed through
		  logic, and that automated deduction technology can be
		  exploited for solving it. More precisely, we rely on
		  first-order clausal logic with some default negation
		  principle, and we propose a model computation theorem
		  prover as a suitable deduction mechanism. \par Beyond
		  solving the task at hand as such, with this work we
		  contribute to the quest for arguments in favor of automated
		  deduction techniques in the ``real world''. Also, we argue
		  why we think that automated deduction techniques are the
		  best choice here.}

                  workshops in this series, FTP 2000 provides a forum for
                  presentation of recent work and discussion of research in
                  progress on First-order Theorem Proving as a core theme of
                  automated deduction. More information about the FTP
                  workshop series is available from the web page {\tt

                  FTP 2000 consists of three invited talks, 18 regular
                  papers, and two position papers. The topics of these papers
                  match very well those of the workshop which cover automated
                  theorem proving in first-order classical, many-valued, and

                  affine logic (i.e.\ clauses with xor as the connective) and
                  cannot be efficiently (if at all) solved by using CNF-only
                  provers. \par We present a decision procedure to
                  \emph{efficiently} decide such problems. The Gauss-DPLL
                  procedure is a tight integration in a unifying framework of
                  a Gauss-Elimina\-tion procedure (for affine logic) and a
                  Davis-Putnam-Logeman-Loveland procedure (for usual clause
                  logic). \par The key idea, which distinguishes our approach
                  from others, is the full interaction bewteen the two parts
                  which makes it possible to maximise (deterministic)
                  simplification rules by passing around newly created unit
                  or binary clauses in either of these parts. We show the
                  correcteness and the termination of Gauss-DPLL under very
                  liberal assumptions.}

		  K{\"u}h97] with a clause transformation turning the
		  abductive task into a model generation problem and show the
		  completeness of this transformation with respect to the
		  computation of abuctive explanations. This abductive
		  inference is applied to the resolution of anaphoric
		  expressions in our general model constructing framework for

		  argue to be useful for computing information updates from
		  natural language utterances [Vel96].}

                  This combination generalizes well-known tableaux techniques

                  methods and tableaux calculi. Proof procedures for these
                  type of calculi developed so far suffer from not exploiting
                  proof confluence, and very often unnecessarily rely on a
                  heavily backtrack oriented control regime. \par As a new
                  result, we present a variant of a connection calculus and
                  prove its {\em strong\/} completeness. This enables the
                  design of backtrack-free control regimes. To demonstrate
                  that the underlying fairness condition is reasonably
                  implementable we define an effective search strategy. We
                  show that with the new approach the search space can be
                  exponentially smaller than those of current,
                  backtracking-oriented proof procedures based on {\em
                  weak\/} completeness results.}

		  \cite{Baumgartner:Furbach:PROTEIN:CADE12:94}. In order to

		  Elimination by a concept of simplification based on
		  conditional rewrite rules. The extension is defined in such
		  a way that rewrite rules as given from the KIV system can
		  easily be accommodated. In the paper, we describe the new
		  simplification technique, discuss completeness, and
		  demonstrate with practical practical experiments from the
		  KIV domain the benefits.}

  ABSTRACT = {This thesis is on extensions of calculi for automated
		  theorem proving towards theory reasoning. It focuses on
		  connection methods\index{Connection!Method} and in
		  particular on theory model elimination (TME). For TME the
		  emphasis lies on the combination with theory reasoners to
		  be obtained by new compilation approach. \par Several
		  theory-reasoning versions of connection calculi are defined
		  and related to each other. In doing so, TME will be
		  selected as a base to be developed further. The final
		  versions are search-space restricted versions of total TME,
		  partial TME and partial restart TME. These versions all are
		  {\em answer\/}-complete, thus making TME interesting for
		  logic programming and problem-solving applications. \par A
		  theory reasoning system is only operable in combination
		  with an (efficient) background reasoner for the theories of
		  interest. Instead of hand-crafting respective background
		  reasoners, a more general approach --- linearizing
		  completion --- is proposed. Linearizing completion enables
		  the {\em automatic\/} construction of background calculi
		  suitable for TME-based theory reasoning systems from a wide
		  range of axiomatically given theories, namely Horn
		  theories. \par Technically, linearizing completion is a
		  device for combining the unit-resulting strategy of
		  resolution with a goal-oriented, linear strategy {\`a} la
		  Prolog in a refutationally complete way. The method is
		  presented in detail. \par Finally, an implementation
		  extending the PTTP technique (Prolog based Technology
		  Theorem Proving) towards theory reasoning is described, and
		  the usefulness of the methods developed in this text will
		  be experimentally demonstrated.},

  ABSTRACT = { We introduce and discuss a number of refinements for

		  are motivated by the use of RME as an interpreter for
		  disjunctive logic programming. Especially head selection
		  function, computation rule, strictness and independence of
		  the goal clause are motivated by aiming at a procedural
		  interpretation of clauses. Other refinements like
		  regularity and early cancellation pruning are techniques to
		  handle the tremendous search space. We discuss these
		  techniques and investigate their compatibility. As a new
		  result we give a proof of completeness for RME with early
		  cancellation pruning; we furthermore show that this
		  powerful refinement is compatibel with regularity tests. }

		  and thus serves as an example of a successful application
		  of deduction techniques to real-world applications.}

		  These calculi allow for theory reasoning using a Model

		  detail and their major properties are shown. Then, a
		  detailed description how TME by Linearizing Completion and
		  RME can be implemented on top of {\small SETHEO}'s Abstract
		  Machine (SAM) is given. Due to the flexibility of the
		  Abstract Machine and its input language LOP, only simple
		  transformations of the input formula are sufficient to
		  obtain an efficient implementation. Only for RME, one
		  machine-instruction of the SAM had to be modified slightly.
		  We present results of experiments comparing plain {\small
		  SETHEO} with an implementation of TME with PTTP (PROTEIN)
		  and the {\small SETHEO} implementation presented here.}

		  Horn\/} clauses are enhanced with an interface to efficient
		  constraint solvers. The question arises whether it is
		  possible to incorporate constraint processing into general,
		  non-Horn theorem proving calculi. In this paper, a positive
		  answer to this question will be given. A framework for a
		  new calculus is introduced which combines model elimination
		  with constraint solving, following the lines of
		  B{\"u}rckert (1991). A prototype system has been
		  implemented rapidly by only combining a PROLOG technology
		  implementation of model elimination and PROLOG with
		  constraints. Some example studies, e.g. taxonomic
		  reasoning, show the advantages and some problems with this
		  procedure. }

  ABSTRACT = {{\em Theory reasoning} is a kind of two-level reasoning in
		  automated theorem proving, where the knowledge of a given
		  domain or theory is separated and treated by special
		  purpose inference rules. We define a classification for the
		  various approaches for theory reasoning which is based on
		  the syntactic concepts of {\em literal level --- term level
		  --- variable level\/}. The main part is a review of theory
		  extensions of common calculi (resolution, model elimination
		  and a connection method). In order to see the relationships
		  among these calculi, we define a super-calculus called {\em
		  theory consolution\/}. Completeness of the various theory
		  calculi is proven. Finally, due to its relevance in
		  automated reasoning, we describe current ways of equality
		  handling.},
