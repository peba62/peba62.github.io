<blockquote><font size="-1">
Many applications of automated deduction require reasoning in first-order logic 
modulo background theories, in particular some form of integer arithmetic. A major
unsolved research challenge is to design theorem provers that are &ldquo;reasonably
complete&rdquo; even in the presence of free function symbols ranging into a background
theory sort. The hierarchic superposition calculus
of Bachmair, Ganzinger, and Waldmann already supports such
symbols, but, as we demonstrate, not optimally. This paper aims to rectify the
situation by introducing a novel form of clause abstraction, a core component in the
hierarchic superposition calculus for transforming clauses into a form
needed for internal operation. We argue for the benefits of the resulting calculus
and provide a new 
completeness result for the fragment where all background-sorted terms are ground.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Current approaches to analyzing dynamic systems are mostly
                  grounded in propositional (temporal) logics.  As a
                  consequence, they often lack expressivity for modelling rich
                  data structures and reasoning about them in the course of a
                  computation. To address this problem, we propose a rich
                  modelling framework based on first-order logic over
                  background theories (arithmetics, lists, records, etc) and
                  state transition systems over corresponding interpretations.
                  On the reasoning side, we introduce a tableau calculus for
                  bounded model checking of properties expressed in a certain
                  fragment of CTL* over that first-order logic. We also
                  describe a k-induction scheme on top of that calculus for
                  proving safety properties, and we report on first
                  experiments with a prototypical implementation.

We consider the problem of automatically disproving invalid conjectures over data
  structures such as lists and arrays over integers, in the presence of additional
  hypotheses over these data structures.
  We investigate a simple approach based on refutational theorem
  proving. We assume that the data structure axioms are satisfiable and provide a
  template language for additional hypotheses such that satisfiability is
  preserved. Then, disproving is done by proving that the negated conjecture
  follows. By means of examples, we demonstrate that our template language is
  reasonably expressive and that our approach works well with current theorem provers
  (Z3, SPASS+T and Beagle).

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Many applications of automated deduction and verification require reasoning in
combinations of theories, such as, on the one hand (some fragment of)
first-order logic, and on, the other hand a background theory, such as some
form of arithmetic.  Unfortunately, due to the high expressivity of the full
logic, complete reasoning is impossible in general. It is a
realistic goal, however, to devise theorem provers that are &ldquo;reasonably
complete&rdquo; in practice, and  the hierarchic superposition calculus has been designed as a
theoretical basis for that. In a recent paper we 
introduced an extension of hierarchic superposition and proved its
completeness for the fragment where every term of the background sort is
ground.  In this paper, we extend this result and obtain completeness for a
larger fragment that admits variables in certain places.
