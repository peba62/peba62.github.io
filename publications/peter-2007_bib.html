  abstract = {In most theorem proving applications, a proper treatment of
  equational theories or equality is mandatory.  In this paper we show
  how to integrate a modern treatment of equality in the hyper tableau
  calculus.  It is based on splitting of positive clauses and an adapted
  version of the superposition inference rule, where equations used for
  paramodulation are drawn (only) from a set of positive unit clauses,
  the candidate model. The
  calculus also features a generic, semantically justified
  simplification rule which covers many redundancy elimination techniques
  known from superposition-style theorem proving. 
  Our main theoretical result is the soundness and completeness of the
  calculus. The calculus is implemented, and we also report on
  practical experiments.}
