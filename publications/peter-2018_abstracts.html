 Correction: The complexity result in Theorem 4 is incorrect. The
  incorrectnes is based on an oversight in the use of a Tseitin-style CNF
  transformation when progressing LTL formulas to the next state. A correct
  progression-based algorithm, of higher complexity though, employs standard
  CNF instead. The soundness theorem (Theorem 5), and completeness theorem
  (Theorem 6) still apply with that correction. Moreover, and importantly, it
  is such a correct version that we had implemented and used in our
  experiments. The experimental results, hence, are not affected by the
  incorrectnes, and neither are the other results.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
We present an algorithm for computing cost-optimal stochastic policies for
Stochastic Shortest Path problems (SSPs) subject to multi-objective PLTL
constraints, i.e., conjunctions of probabilistic LTL formulas.
Established algorithms capable of solving this problem typically stem from the
area of probabilistic verification, and struggle with the large state spaces and
constraint types found in automated planning.
Our approach differs in two crucial ways.
Firstly it operates entirely on-the-fly, bypassing the expensive construction of
Rabin automata for the formulas and their prohibitive prior synchronisation with
the full state space of the SSP.
Secondly, it extends recent heuristic search algorithms and admissible
heuristics for cost-constrained SSPs, to enable pruning regions made infeasible
by the PLTL constraints.
We prove our algorithm correct and optimal, and demonstrate
encouraging scalability results.
