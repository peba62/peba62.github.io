		  calculus and prove its completeness. Theory reasoning means
		  to relieve a calculus from explicitly drawing inferences in
		  a given theory by special purpose inference rules (e.g.
		  E-resolution for equality reasoning). We take advantage of
		  orderings (e.g. simplification orderings) by disallowing to
		  resolve upon clauses which violate certain maximality
		  constraints; stated positively, a resolvent may only be
		  built if all the selected literals are maximal in their
		  clauses. By this technique the search space is drastically
		  pruned. As an instantiation for theory reasoning we show
		  that equality can be built in by rigid E-unification. }

		  separate the knowledge of a given domain or theory and
		  treat it by special purpose inference rules. We present two
		  versions of theory model elimination: the one is called
		  {\em total theory model elimination} (which allows e.g. to
		  treat equality in a rigid E-resolution style), and the
		  other is called {\em partial theory model elimination}
		  (which allows e.g. to treat equality in a paramodulation

  abstract = {{\em Theory reasoning} is a kind of two-level reasoning in
		  automated theorem proving, where the knowledge of a given
		  domain or theory is separated and treated by special
		  purpose inference rules. We define a classification for the
		  various approaches for theory reasoning which is based on
		  the syntactic concepts of {\em literal level --- term level
		  --- variable level\/}. The main part is a review of theory
		  extensions of common calculi (resolution, model elimination
		  and a connection method). In order to see the relationships
		  among these calculi, we define a super-calculus called {\em
		  theory consolution\/}. Completeness of the various theory
		  calculi is proven. Finally, due to its relevance in
		  automated reasoning, we describe current ways of equality
		  handling.},
