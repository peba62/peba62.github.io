  expressions in an utterance is essentially an \emph{abductive} task
  following \cite{Hobbs:etal:InterpretationAsAbduction:AIJ:93} who use
  a weighted abduction scheme on horn clauses to deal with
  reference. We give a semantic representation for utterances
  containing anaphora that enables us to compute possible antecedents
  by abductive inference. We extend the disjunctive model construction
  procedure of \emph{hyper tableaux}
  \cite{Baumgartner:Furbach:Niemelae:HyperTableau:JELIA:96,Kuehn:RigidHyperTableaux:KI:97}
  with a clause transformation turning the abductive task into a model
  generation problem and show the completeness of this transformation
  with respect to the computation of abductive explanations. This
  abductive inference is applied to the resolution of anaphoric
  expressions in our general model constructing framework for
  incremental discourse representation which we argue to be useful for
  computing information updates from natural language utterances."

  proving can be used for efficient deductive database updates.  The
  key idea is to transform the given database, together with the update
  request, into a (disjunctive) logic program and to apply the hyper
  tableaux calculus
  to solve the original update problem. The resulting
  algorithm has the following properties: it works goal-directed
  (i.e.\ the search is driven by the update request), it is rational
  in the sense that it satisfies certain rationality postulates
  stemming from philosophical works on belief dynamics, and, unlike
  comparable approaches, it is
  of  polynomial space complexity.  \\
  To obtain soundness and completeness results, the hyper tableau
  calculus is slightly modified for minimal model reasoning. Besides a 
  direct proof we give an alternate proof which gives insights into
  the relation to previous approaches. As a by-product we thereby
  derive a  soundness and completeness result of hyper tableaux for
  computing  minimal abductive explanations.",
