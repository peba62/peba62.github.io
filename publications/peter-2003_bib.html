  abstract = { This work is about a ``real-world'' application of
		  automated deduction. The application is the management of
		  documents (such as mathematical textbooks) as they occur in
		  a readily available tool. In this ``Slicing Information
		  Technology tool'', documents are decomposed (``sliced'')
		  into small units. A particular application task is to
		  assemble a new document from such units in a selective way,
		  based on the user's current interest and knowledge. \par It
		  is argued that this task can be naturally expressed through
		  logic, and that automated deduction technology can be
		  exploited for solving it. More precisely, we rely on
		  first-order clausal logic with some default negation
		  principle, and we propose a model computation theorem
		  prover as a suitable deduction mechanism. \par Beyond
		  solving the task at hand as such, with this work we
		  contribute to the quest for arguments in favor of automated
		  deduction techniques in the ``real world''. Also, we argue
		  why we think that automated deduction techniques are the
		  best choice here.},
