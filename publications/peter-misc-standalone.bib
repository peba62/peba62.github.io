This paper describes the Living Book and the use of theorem proving
technology as a core component in the knowledge management system
(KMS) of the Living Book.  The KMS provides a {\em scenario
  management\/} component where teachers may describe those parts of
given documents that are relevant in order to achieve a certain
learning goal. The task of the KMS is to assemble new documents from a
database of elementary units called 'slices' (definitions, theorems,
and so on) in a scenario-based way (like 'I want to prepare for an
exam and need to learn about resolution').
\par
The computation of such assemblies is carried out by a
model-generating theorem prover for first-order logic with a default
negation principle. Its input consists of meta data that describe the
dependencies between different slices, and logic-programming style
rules that describe the scenario-specific composition of slices.
Additionally, a user model is taken into account that contains
information about topics and slices that are known or unknown to a
student. A model computed by the system for such input then directly
specifies the document to be assembled.
\par
This paper introduces the e-learning context we are faced with,
motivates our choice of logic and presents the newly developed
calculus used in the KMS."

	    solvers to date.  Although originally devised as a

	    used almost exclusively for propositional logic so
	    far because of its highly inefficient treatment of

	    The recent FDPLL calculus by Baumgartner was the

	    that, although not necessary for completeness, are
	    crucial for its effectiveness in practice.  
	    \par
	    In this paper, we present a new calculus loosely
	    based on FDPLL that lifts these aspects as well.
	    In addition to being a more faithful litfing of
	    the DPLL procedure, the new calculus contains a
	    more systematic treatment of {\em universal literals\/},

		  Following this idea, in this paper a first-order logic

		  uses a lifted splitting rule, i.e.\  the case analysis is

		  propositional truth assignments. As a nice consequence,
		  FDPLL naturally decides the class of
		  Bernays-Sch{\"o}nfinkel formulas, which is notoriously

		  emphasis lies on the combination with theory reasoners to
		  be obtained by new compilation approach. \par Several
		  theory-reasoning versions of connection calculi are defined
		  and related to each other. In doing so, TME will be
		  selected as a base to be developed further. The final
		  versions are search-space restricted versions of total TME,
		  partial TME and partial restart TME. These versions all are
		  {\em answer\/}-complete, thus making TME interesting for
		  logic programming and problem-solving applications. \par A
		  theory reasoning system is only operable in combination
		  with an (efficient) background reasoner for the theories of
		  interest. Instead of hand-crafting respective background
		  reasoners, a more general approach --- linearizing
		  completion --- is proposed. Linearizing completion enables
		  the {\em automatic\/} construction of background calculi
		  suitable for TME-based theory reasoning systems from a wide
		  range of axiomatically given theories, namely Horn
		  theories. \par Technically, linearizing completion is a
		  device for combining the unit-resulting strategy of
		  resolution with a goal-oriented, linear strategy {\`a} la
		  Prolog in a refutationally complete way. The method is
		  presented in detail. \par Finally, an implementation
		  extending the PTTP technique (Prolog based Technology
		  Theorem Proving) towards theory reasoning is described, and
		  the usefulness of the methods developed in this text will

  abstract	= "{\em Theory reasoning} is a kind of two-level reasoning in
		  automated theorem proving, where the knowledge of a given
		  domain or theory is separated and treated by special
		  purpose inference rules. We define a classification for the
		  various approaches for theory reasoning which is based on
		  the syntactic concepts of {\em literal level --- term level
		  --- variable level\/}. The main part is a review of theory
		  extensions of common calculi (resolution, model elimination
		  and a connection method). In order to see the relationships
		  among these calculi, we define a super-calculus called {\em
		  theory consolution\/}. Completeness of the various theory
		  calculi is proven. Finally, due to its relevance in
		  automated reasoning, we describe current ways of equality
		  handling.",
