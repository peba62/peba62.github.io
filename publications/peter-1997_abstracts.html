<blockquote><font size="-1">
 We introduce and discuss a number of refinements for
		  restart model elimination (RME). Most of these refinements
		  are motivated by the use of RME as an interpreter for
		  disjunctive logic programming. Especially head selection
		  function, computation rule, strictness and independence of
		  the goal clause are motivated by aiming at a procedural
		  interpretation of clauses. Other refinements like
		  regularity and early cancellation pruning are techniques to
		  handle the tremendous search space. We discuss these
		  techniques and investigate their compatibility. As a new
		  result we give a proof of completeness for RME with early
		  cancellation pruning; we furthermore show that this
		  powerful refinement is compatibel with regularity tests.

We introduce a bottom-up and a top-down calculus for

 In this paper, we show how techniques from disjunctive

		  the update request into a disjunctive logic program and
		  apply disjunctive techniques (such as minimal model
		  reasoning) to solve the original update problem. We present
		  two variants of our algorithm both of which are of

<blockquote><font size="-1">
The Model Elimination (ME) calculus is a refutationally
		  complete, goal-oriented calculus for first-order clause
		  logic. In this paper, we introduce a new variant called
		  <em>disjunctive positive ME (DPME)</em>; it improves on
		  Plaisted's positive refinement of ME in that reduction
		  steps are allowed only with positive literals stemming from
		  clauses having at least two positive literals (so-called
		  <em>disjunctive</em> clauses). <p>DPME is motivated by its
		  application to various kinds of <em>subsumption</em>
		  deletion: in order to apply subsumption deletion in ME
		  equally successful as in Resolution, it is crucial to
		  employ a version of ME which minimizes ancestor context
		  (i.e. the necessary A-literals to find a refutation). DPME
		  meets this demand. We describe several variants of ME with
		  subsumption, with the most important ones being <em>ME
		  with backward and forward subsumption</em> and the <em>
		  T<sup>*</sup>-Context Check</em>. We compare their pruning power,
		  also taking into consideration the well-known regularity
		  restriction. <p>All proofs are supplied. The
