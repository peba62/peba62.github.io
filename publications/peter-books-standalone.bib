		  calculi and proof procedures for first-order connection
		  methods and tableaux calculi. Proof procedures for these
		  type of calculi developed so far suffer from not exploiting
		  proof confluence, and very often unnecessarily rely on a
		  heavily backtrack oriented control regime. \par As a new
		  result, we present a variant of a connection calculus and
		  prove its {\em strong\/} completeness. This enables the
		  design of backtrack-free control regimes. To demonstrate
		  that the underlying fairness condition is reasonably
		  implementable we define an effective search strategy. We
		  show that with the new approach the search space can be
		  exponentially smaller than those of current,
		  backtracking-oriented proof procedures based on {\em
		  weak\/} completeness results."
