  abstract = {``Hyper tableaux'' is a sound and complete calculus for
		  first-order clausal logic. The present paper introduces an
		  improvement which removes the major weakness of the
		  calculus, which is the need to (at least partially) blindly
		  guess ground-instantiations for certain clauses. This
		  guessing is now replaced by a unification-driven technique.
		  \par The calculus is presented in detail, which includes a
		  completeness proof. Completeness is proven by using a novel
		  approach to extract a model from an open branch. This
		  enables semantical redundancy criteria which are not
		  present in related approaches.}
