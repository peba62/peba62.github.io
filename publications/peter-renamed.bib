  how to integrate a modern treatment of equality in the Model
  Evolution calculus (ME), a first-order version of the propositional
  DPLL procedure.  The new calculus, MEE, is a proper extension of
  the ME calculus without equality. Like ME it maintains an explicit
  ``candidate model'', which is searched for by DPLL-style splitting.
  For equational reasoning MEE uses an adapted version of the ordered
  paramodulation inference rule, where equations used for
  paramodulation are drawn (only) from the candidate model. The
  calculus also features a generic, semantically justified
  simplification rule which covers many simplification techniques
  known from superposition-style theorem proving.
  Our main result is the correctness of the MEE calculus in the
  presence of very general redundancy elimination criteria.",

	    used almost exclusively for propositional logic so

	    quantifiers, based on instantiation into ground

	    \par
	    The recent FDPLL calculus by Baumgartner was the
	    first successful attempt to lift the procedure to
	    the first-order level without recurring to ground
	    instantiations.  FDPLL lifts to the first-order
	    case the core of the DPLL procedure, the splitting
	    rule, but ignores other aspects of the procedure
	    that, although not necessary for completeness, are
	    crucial for its effectiveness in practice.  
	    \par
	    In this paper, we present a new calculus loosely
	    based on FDPLL that lifts these aspects as well.
	    In addition to being a more faithful litfing of
	    the DPLL procedure, the new calculus contains a
	    more systematic treatment of {\em universal literals\/},
	    one of FDPLL's optimizations, and so has the

This paper describes the Living Book and the use of theorem proving
technology as a core component in the knowledge management system
(KMS) of the Living Book.  The KMS provides a {\em scenario
  management\/} component where teachers may describe those parts of
given documents that are relevant in order to achieve a certain
learning goal. The task of the KMS is to assemble new documents from a
database of elementary units called 'slices' (definitions, theorems,
and so on) in a scenario-based way (like 'I want to prepare for an
exam and need to learn about resolution').
\par
The computation of such assemblies is carried out by a
model-generating theorem prover for first-order logic with a default
negation principle. Its input consists of meta data that describe the
dependencies between different slices, and logic-programming style
rules that describe the scenario-specific composition of slices.
Additionally, a user model is taken into account that contains
information about topics and slices that are known or unknown to a
student. A model computed by the system for such input then directly
specifies the document to be assembled.
\par
This paper introduces the e-learning context we are faced with,
motivates our choice of logic and presents the newly developed
calculus used in the KMS."

		  automated deduction. The application is the management of
		  documents (such as mathematical textbooks) as they occur in
		  a readily available tool. In this ``Slicing Information
		  Technology tool'', documents are decomposed (``sliced'')
		  into small units. A particular application task is to
		  assemble a new document from such units in a selective way,
		  based on the user's current interest and knowledge. \par It
		  is argued that this task can be naturally expressed through
		  logic, and that automated deduction technology can be
		  exploited for solving it. More precisely, we rely on
		  first-order clausal logic with some default negation
		  principle, and we propose a model computation theorem
		  prover as a suitable deduction mechanism. \par Beyond
		  solving the task at hand as such, with this work we
		  contribute to the quest for arguments in favor of automated
		  deduction techniques in the ``real world''. Also, we argue
		  why we think that automated deduction techniques are the

		  be obtained by new compilation approach. \par Several
		  theory-reasoning versions of connection calculi are defined
		  and related to each other. In doing so, TME will be
		  selected as a base to be developed further. The final
		  versions are search-space restricted versions of total TME,
		  partial TME and partial restart TME. These versions all are
		  {\em answer\/}-complete, thus making TME interesting for
		  logic programming and problem-solving applications. \par A
		  theory reasoning system is only operable in combination
		  with an (efficient) background reasoner for the theories of
		  interest. Instead of hand-crafting respective background
		  reasoners, a more general approach --- linearizing
		  completion --- is proposed. Linearizing completion enables
		  the {\em automatic\/} construction of background calculi
		  suitable for TME-based theory reasoning systems from a wide
		  range of axiomatically given theories, namely Horn
		  theories. \par Technically, linearizing completion is a
		  device for combining the unit-resulting strategy of
		  resolution with a goal-oriented, linear strategy {\`a} la
		  Prolog in a refutationally complete way. The method is
		  presented in detail. \par Finally, an implementation
		  extending the PTTP technique (Prolog based Technology
		  Theorem Proving) towards theory reasoning is described, and

  abstract	= {This paper presents an implementation for the efficient
		  execution of Theory Model Elimination (TME), TME by
		  Linearizing Completion, and Restart Model Elimination (RME)
		  on top of the automated theorem prover {\small SETHEO}.
		  These calculi allow for theory reasoning using a Model
		  Elimination based theorem prover. They are described in
		  detail and their major properties are shown. Then, a
		  detailed description how TME by Linearizing Completion and
		  RME can be implemented on top of {\small SETHEO}'s Abstract
		  Machine (SAM) is given. Due to the flexibility of the
		  Abstract Machine and its input language LOP, only simple
		  transformations of the input formula are sufficient to
		  obtain an efficient implementation. Only for RME, one
		  machine-instruction of the SAM had to be modified slightly.
		  We present results of experiments comparing plain {\small
		  SETHEO} with an implementation of TME with PTTP (PROTEIN)
		  and the {\small SETHEO} implementation presented here.}

		  with constraint solving, following the lines of
		  B{\"u}rckert (1991). A prototype system has been
