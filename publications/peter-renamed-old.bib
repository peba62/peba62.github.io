		  first-order clausal logic with some default negation
		  principle, and we propose a model computation theorem

		  conjunction with {\em Tableaux 2000\/}, the major
		  international conference for automated reasoning with
		  analytic tableaux and related methods ({\tt
		  http://i12www.ira.uka.de/TABLEAUX/}). Like the preceding
		  workshops in this series, FTP 2000 provides a forum for
		  presentation of recent work and discussion of research in
		  progress on First-order Theorem Proving as a core theme of
		  automated deduction. More information about the FTP
		  workshop series is available from the web page {\tt
		  http://www.logic.at/FTP/}. \par The technical program of
		  FTP 2000 consists of three invited talks, 18 regular
		  papers, and two position papers. The topics of these papers
		  match very well those of the workshop which cover automated
		  theorem proving in first-order classical, many-valued, and
		  modal logics, including nonexclusively: resolution,
		  equational reasoning, term-rewriting, model construction,
		  constraint reasoning, unification, propositional logic,
		  specialized decision procedures; strategies and complexity
		  of theorem proving procedures; and applications of
		  first-order theorem provers to problems in verification,

		  the goal clause are motivated by aiming at a procedural
		  interpretation of clauses. Other refinements like
		  regularity and early cancellation pruning are techniques to
		  handle the tremendous search space. We discuss these
