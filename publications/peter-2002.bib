  abstract = {In the era of information technology, providing high
		  quality and state of the art educational material is quite
		  a challenge and requires the use of new media. The In2Math
		  project at the University of Koblenz-Landau develops in
		  this context the {\em Living Book\/}; Living Book means
		  personalized user oriented educational material together
		  with interactive components. The Living Book aims at
		  supporting the fundamental parts of undergraduate classes
		  in theoretical computer science. The main goal is to
		  support the active, explorative and self-determined
		  learning in lectures, tutorials and selfstudy. \par This
		  paper describes the main aspects of the Living Book and
		  explains the concepts and ideas behind it as well as the
		  techniques used to realized these concepts. }

  abstract = { The Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland procedure (DPLL) was
		  introduced in the early 60s as a proof procedure for
		  first-order logic. Nowadays, only its propositional logic
		  core component is widely used in efficient propositional
		  logic provers and respective applications. This success
		  motivates to reconsider lifting DPLL to the first-order
		  logic level in a more contemporary way, by exploiting
		  successful first-order techniques like ``unification''.
		  Following this idea, in this paper a first-order logic
		  version of DPLL, FDPLL, is presented. \par While
		  propositional DPLL is based on a splitting rule for case
		  analysis wrt.\  ground and complementary literals, FDPLL
		  uses a lifted splitting rule, i.e.\  the case analysis is
		  made wrt.\ non-ground and complementary literals now. To
		  make this work, a new way of treating variables is
		  employed. It comes together with a compact way of
		  representing and reasoning with first-order logic
		  interpretations, much like propositional DPLL reasons about
		  propositional truth assignments. As a nice consequence,
		  FDPLL naturally decides the class of
		  Bernays-Sch{\"o}nfinkel formulas, which is notoriously
		  difficult for most other calculi.}
