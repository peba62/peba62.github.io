 Correction: The complexity result in Theorem 4 is incorrect. The
  incorrectnes is based on an oversight in the use of a Tseitin-style CNF
  transformation when progressing LTL formulas to the next state. A correct
  progression-based algorithm, of higher complexity though, employs standard
  CNF instead. The soundness theorem (Theorem 5), and completeness theorem
  (Theorem 6) still apply with that correction. Moreover, and importantly, it
  is such a correct version that we had implemented and used in our
  experiments. The experimental results, hence, are not affected by the
  incorrectnes, and neither are the other results.
