  abstract = {We present a new transformation method by which a given
		  Horn theory is transformed in such a way that resolution
		  derivations can be carried out which are both linear (in
		  the sense of Prologs SLD-resolution) {\em and\/}
		  unit-resulting (i.e.\ the resolvents are unit clauses).
		  This is not trivial since although both strategies alone
		  are complete, their na{{\"\i}}{}ve combination is not.
		  Completeness is recovered by our method through a
		  completion procedure in the spirit of Knuth-Bendix
		  completion, however with different ordering criteria. A
		  powerful redundancy criterion helps to find a finite system
		  quite often. \\ The transformed theory can be used in
		  combination with linear calculi such as e.g.\ (theory)
		  model elimination to yield sound, complete and efficient
		  calculi for full first order clause logic over the given
		  Horn theory. \\ As an example application, our method
		  discovers a generalization of the well-known linear
		  paramodulation calculus for the combined theory of equality
		  and strict orderings. \\ The method has been implemented
		  and has been tested in conjunction with a model elimination
		  theorem prover.},

  abstract = {This thesis is on extensions of calculi for automated
		  theorem proving towards theory reasoning. It focuses on
		  connection methods\index{Connection!Method} and in
		  particular on theory model elimination (TME). For TME the
		  emphasis lies on the combination with theory reasoners to
		  be obtained by new compilation approach. \par Several
		  theory-reasoning versions of connection calculi are defined
		  and related to each other. In doing so, TME will be
		  selected as a base to be developed further. The final
		  versions are search-space restricted versions of total TME,
		  partial TME and partial restart TME. These versions all are
		  {\em answer\/}-complete, thus making TME interesting for
		  logic programming and problem-solving applications. \par A
		  theory reasoning system is only operable in combination
		  with an (efficient) background reasoner for the theories of
		  interest. Instead of hand-crafting respective background
		  reasoners, a more general approach --- linearizing
		  completion --- is proposed. Linearizing completion enables
		  the {\em automatic\/} construction of background calculi
		  suitable for TME-based theory reasoning systems from a wide
		  range of axiomatically given theories, namely Horn
		  theories. \par Technically, linearizing completion is a
		  device for combining the unit-resulting strategy of
		  resolution with a goal-oriented, linear strategy {\`a} la
		  Prolog in a refutationally complete way. The method is
		  presented in detail. \par Finally, an implementation
		  extending the PTTP technique (Prolog based Technology
		  Theorem Proving) towards theory reasoning is described, and
		  the usefulness of the methods developed in this text will
		  be experimentally demonstrated.},
