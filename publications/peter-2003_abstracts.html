Three real world applications are depicted which all have

This system description is about a real-world application

		  is to support the active, explorative and self-determined
		  learning in lectures, tutorials and self study. It includes
		  a course on 'logic for computer scientists' with a uniform
		  access to various tools like theorem provers and an

		  This course is routinely used within teaching undergraduate

 This work is about a &ldquo;real-world&rdquo; application of
		  automated deduction. The application is the management of
		  documents (such as mathematical textbooks) as they occur in
		  a readily available tool. In this &ldquo;Slicing Information
		  Technology tool&rdquo;, documents are decomposed (&ldquo;sliced&rdquo;)
		  into small units. A particular application task is to
		  assemble a new document from such units in a selective way,
		  based on the user's current interest and knowledge. <p>It
		  is argued that this task can be naturally expressed through
		  logic, and that automated deduction technology can be
		  exploited for solving it. More precisely, we rely on
		  first-order clausal logic with some default negation
		  principle, and we propose a model computation theorem
		  prover as a suitable deduction mechanism. <p>Beyond
		  solving the task at hand as such, with this work we
		  contribute to the quest for arguments in favor of automated
		  deduction techniques in the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;. Also, we argue
		  why we think that automated deduction techniques are the
		  best choice here.
