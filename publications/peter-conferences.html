The DPLL procedure, due to Davis, Putnam,
	    Logemann, and Loveland, is the basis of some of
	    the most successful propositional satisfiability
	    solvers to date.  Although originally devised as a
	    proof-procedure for first-order logic, it has been
	    used almost exclusively for propositional logic so
	    far because of its highly inefficient treatment of
	    quantifiers, based on instantiation into ground
	    formulas.
	    <p>
	    The recent FDPLL calculus by Baumgartner was the
	    first successful attempt to lift the procedure to
	    the first-order level without recurring to ground
	    instantiations.  FDPLL lifts to the first-order
	    case the core of the DPLL procedure, the splitting
	    rule, but ignores other aspects of the procedure
	    that, although not necessary for completeness, are
	    crucial for its effectiveness in practice.  
	    <p>
	    In this paper, we present a new calculus loosely
	    based on FDPLL that lifts these aspects as well.
	    In addition to being a more faithful litfing of
	    the DPLL procedure, the new calculus contains a
	    more systematic treatment of <em>universal literals</em>,
	    one of FDPLL's optimizations, and so has the
	    potential of leading to much faster
	    implementations.

FDPLL is a directly lifted version of the well-known
  Davis-Putnam-Logeman-Loveland (DPLL) procedure.  While DPLL is based
  on a splitting rule for case analysis wrt. ground and complementary
  literals, FDPLL uses a lifted splitting rule, i.e. the case
  analysis is made wrt. non-ground and complementary literals now.
  <p>
  The motivation for this lifting is to bring together successful first-order
  techniques like unification and subsumption to the propositionally
  successful DPLL procedure.
  <p>
  At the heart of the method is a new technique to represent
  first-order interpretations, where a literal specifies truth values
  for all its ground instances, unless there is a more specific
  literal specifying opposite truth values.  Based on this idea, the
  FDPLL calculus is developed and proven as
  strongly complete.

 An Ordered Theory Resolution Calculus.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
In this paper we present an ordered theory resolution
		  calculus and prove its completeness. Theory reasoning means
		  to relieve a calculus from explicitly drawing inferences in
		  a given theory by special purpose inference rules (e.g.
		  E-resolution for equality reasoning). We take advantage of
		  orderings (e.g. simplification orderings) by disallowing to
		  resolve upon clauses which violate certain maximality
		  constraints; stated positively, a resolvent may only be
		  built if all the selected literals are maximal in their
		  clauses. By this technique the search space is drastically
		  pruned. As an instantiation for theory reasoning we show
		  that equality can be built in by rigid E-unification.

The <em>model elimination calculus</em> is a linear,
		  refutationally complete calculus for first order clause
		  logic. We show how to extend this calculus with a framework
		  for <em>theory reasoning</em>. Theory reasoning means to
		  separate the knowledge of a given domain or theory and
		  treat it by special purpose inference rules. We present two
		  versions of theory model elimination: the one is called
		  <em>total theory model elimination</em> (which allows e.g. to
		  treat equality in a rigid E-resolution style), and the
		  other is called <em>partial theory model elimination</em>
		  (which allows e.g. to treat equality in a paramodulation
		  style).
