  abstract = {Markov decision processes (MDPs) are the standard formalism for
modelling sequential decision making in stochastic environments. Policy
synthesis addresses the problem of how to control or limit the decisions an
agent makes so that a given specification is met. In this paper we
consider PCTL*, the probabilistic counterpart of CTL*, as the specification
language. Because in general the policy synthesis problem for
PCTL* is undecidable, we restrict to policies whose execution history memory
is finitely bounded a priori.
Surprisingly, no algorithm for policy synthesis for this natural and
expressive framework has been developed so far.  We close this gap and
describe a tableau-based algorithm that, given an MDP and a PCTL* specification, derives
in a non-deterministic way a system of (possibly nonlinear) equalities
and inequalities. The solutions of this system, if any, describe the
desired (stochastic) policies.
Our main result in this paper is the correctness of our method, i.e.,
soundness, completeness and termination.}
