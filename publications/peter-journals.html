<blockquote><font size="-1">
In this paper, we argue that the resolution of anaphoric
  expressions in an utterance is essentially an <em>abductive</em> task
  following [?] who use
  a weighted abduction scheme on horn clauses to deal with
  reference. We give a semantic representation for utterances
  containing anaphora that enables us to compute possible antecedents
  by abductive inference. We extend the disjunctive model construction
  procedure of <em>hyper tableaux</em>
  [?]
  with a clause transformation turning the abductive task into a model
  generation problem and show the completeness of this transformation
  with respect to the computation of abductive explanations. This
  abductive inference is applied to the resolution of anaphoric
  expressions in our general model constructing framework for
  incremental discourse representation which we argue to be useful for
  computing information updates from natural language utterances.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
In this paper, we show how techniques from first-order theorem
  proving can be used for efficient deductive database updates.  The
  key idea is to transform the given database, together with the update
  request, into a (disjunctive) logic program and to apply the hyper
  tableaux calculus
  to solve the original update problem. The resulting
  algorithm has the following properties: it works goal-directed
  (i.e. the search is driven by the update request), it is rational
  in the sense that it satisfies certain rationality postulates
  stemming from philosophical works on belief dynamics, and, unlike
  comparable approaches, it is
  of  polynomial space complexity.  <br>
  To obtain soundness and completeness results, the hyper tableau
  calculus is slightly modified for minimal model reasoning. Besides a 
  direct proof we give an alternate proof which gives insights into
  the relation to previous approaches. As a by-product we thereby
  derive a  soundness and completeness result of hyper tableaux for
  computing  minimal abductive explanations.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
We demonstrate that theorem provers using model
		  elimination (ME) can be used as answer-complete
		  interpreters for <em>disjunctive logic programming</em>.
		  More specifically, we introduce a family of restart
		  variants of model elimination, and we introduce a mechanism
		  for computing answers. Building on this, we develop a new
		  calculus called <em>ancestry restart ME</em>. This variant
		  admits a more restrictive regularity restriction than
		  restart ME, and, as a side effect, it is in particular
		  attractive for computing definite answers. The presented
		  calculi can also be used successfully in the context of
		  <em>automated theorem proving</em>. We demonstrate
		  experimentally that it is more difficult to compute
		  non-trivial answers to goals than to prove the <em>
		  existence</em> of answers.

 A Disjunctive Positive Refinement of Model Elimination and its

<blockquote><font size="-1">
The Model Elimination (ME) calculus is a refutationally
		  complete, goal-oriented calculus for first-order clause
		  logic. In this paper, we introduce a new variant called
		  <em>disjunctive positive ME (DPME)</em>; it improves on
		  Plaisted's positive refinement of ME in that reduction
		  steps are allowed only with positive literals stemming from
		  clauses having at least two positive literals (so-called
		  <em>disjunctive</em> clauses). <p>DPME is motivated by its
		  application to various kinds of <em>subsumption</em>
		  deletion: in order to apply subsumption deletion in ME
		  equally successful as in Resolution, it is crucial to
		  employ a version of ME which minimizes ancestor context
		  (i.e. the necessary A-literals to find a refutation). DPME
		  meets this demand. We describe several variants of ME with
		  subsumption, with the most important ones being <em>ME
		  with backward and forward subsumption</em> and the <em>
		  T<sup>*</sup>-Context Check</em>. We compare their pruning power,
		  also taking into consideration the well-known regularity
		  restriction. <p>All proofs are supplied. The
		  practicability of our approach is demonstrated with
		  experiments.

 Linear and Unit-Resulting Refutations for Horn Theories.
 <em>Journal of Automated Reasoning</em>, 16(3):241--319, June 1996.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
We present a new transformation method by which a given
		  Horn theory is transformed in such a way that resolution
		  derivations can be carried out which are both linear (in
		  the sense of Prologs SLD-resolution) <em>and</em>
		  unit-resulting (i.e. the resolvents are unit clauses).
		  This is not trivial since although both strategies alone
		  are complete, their na&iuml;ve combination is not.
		  Completeness is recovered by our method through a
		  completion procedure in the spirit of Knuth-Bendix
		  completion, however with different ordering criteria. A
		  powerful redundancy criterion helps to find a finite system
		  quite often. <br> The transformed theory can be used in
		  combination with linear calculi such as e.g. (theory)
		  model elimination to yield sound, complete and efficient
		  calculi for full first order clause logic over the given
		  Horn theory. <br> As an example application, our method
		  discovers a generalization of the well-known linear
		  paramodulation calculus for the combined theory of equality
		  and strict orderings. <br> The method has been implemented
		  and has been tested in conjunction with a model elimination
		  theorem prover.
