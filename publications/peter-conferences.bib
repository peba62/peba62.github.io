	    solvers to date.  Although originally devised as a

	    used almost exclusively for propositional logic so
	    far because of its highly inefficient treatment of
	    quantifiers, based on instantiation into ground
	    formulas.
	    \par
	    The recent FDPLL calculus by Baumgartner was the
	    first successful attempt to lift the procedure to
	    the first-order level without recurring to ground
	    instantiations.  FDPLL lifts to the first-order
	    case the core of the DPLL procedure, the splitting
	    rule, but ignores other aspects of the procedure
	    that, although not necessary for completeness, are
	    crucial for its effectiveness in practice.  
	    \par
	    In this paper, we present a new calculus loosely
	    based on FDPLL that lifts these aspects as well.
	    In addition to being a more faithful litfing of
	    the DPLL procedure, the new calculus contains a
	    more systematic treatment of {\em universal literals\/},
	    one of FDPLL's optimizations, and so has the

		  logic. We show how to extend this calculus with a framework
		  for {\em theory reasoning}. Theory reasoning means to
		  separate the knowledge of a given domain or theory and
		  treat it by special purpose inference rules. We present two
		  versions of theory model elimination: the one is called
		  {\em total theory model elimination} (which allows e.g. to
		  treat equality in a rigid E-resolution style), and the
		  other is called {\em partial theory model elimination}
		  (which allows e.g. to treat equality in a paramodulation
		  style). "
