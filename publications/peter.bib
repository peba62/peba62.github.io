  abstract = {FOLD-RM is an explainable machine learning classification algorithm that uses training data to create a set of classification rules. In this paper, we introduce CON-FOLD which extends FOLD-RM in several ways. CON-FOLD assigns probability-based confidence scores to rules learned for a classification task. This allows users to know how confident they should be in a prediction made by the model. We present a confidence-based pruning algorithm that uses the unique structure of FOLD-RM rules to efficiently prune rules and prevent overfitting. Furthermore, CON-FOLD enables the user to provide preexisting knowledge in the form of logic program rules that are either (fixed) background knowledge or (modifiable) initial rule candidates. The paper describes our method in detail and reports on practical experiments. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. For that, we introduce a new metric, Inverse Brier Score, to evaluate the accuracy of the produced confidence scores. Finally, we apply this extension to a real-world example that requires explainability: marking of student responses to a short answer question from the Australian Physics Olympiad.},

  calculus with description logic in a logic programming framework. The purpose is to
  provide the user with an expressive language for modelling and analysing systems that
  evolve over time.
  The approach is exemplified with the logic programming language as implemented in the
  Fusemate system. The paper extends Fusemate's rule language with a weakly DL-safe
  interface to the description logic ALCIF and adapts the event calculus to this extended language.
  This way, time-stamped ABoxes can be manipulated as fluents in the event
  calculus. All that is done in the frame of Fusemate's concept of stratification by time.
  The paper provides conditions for soundness and completeness where appropriate.
  Using an elaborated example it demonstrates the interplay of the event calculus,
  description logic and
  logic programming rules for computing possible models as plausible explanations of the current state
  of the modelled system."

 and is important for fault analysis and debugging of formal
 specifications of security protocols, programs and terminological
 definitions, for example.  This paper discusses several ways of
 enhancing the paradigm of bottom-up model generation, with the
 two main contributions being a new range-restriction
 transformation and generalized blocking techniques.  The
 range-restriction transformation refines existing transformations
 to range-restricted clauses by carefully limiting the creation of
 domain terms.  The blocking techniques are based on simple
 transformations of the input set together with standard equality
 reasoning and redundancy elimination techniques, and allow for
 finding small, finite models.  All possible combinations of the
 introduced techniques and a classical range-restriction technique
 were tested on the clausal problems of the TPTP Version 6.0.0
 with an implementation based on the SPASS theorem prover using a
 hyperresolution-like refinement.  Unrestricted domain blocking
 gave best results for satisfiable problems, showing that it is an
 indispensable technique for bottom-up model generation methods,
 that yields good results in combination with both new and
 classical range-restricting transformations.  Limiting the
 creation of terms during the inference process by using the new
 range-restricting transformation has paid off, especially when
 using it together with a shifting transformation.  The
 experimental results also show that classical range restriction
 with unrestricted blocking provides a useful complementary
 method.  Overall, the results show bottom-up model generation
 methods are good for disproving theorems and generating models
 for satisfiable problems, but less efficient for unsatisfiable
 problems."

  we propose a modular and re-usable system architecture for monitoring systems in terms
  of their state evolution. As a main novelty, states are represented explicitly and are
  amenable to external analysis. Moreovoer, different state trajectories can be derived
  and analysed simultaneously, for dealing with incomplete or noisy input
  data. In the paper we describe the
  system architecture and our implementation of a core component, the state inference
  engine, through a shallow embedding in Scala.
  The implementation of our modelling language as an embeded domain-specific language
  grants the modeller expressive power and flexibility, yet allows us to abstract a
  significant part of the complexity of the model's execution into the common inference
  engine core."

Established algorithms capable of solving this problem typically stem from the
area of probabilistic verification, and struggle with the large state spaces and
constraint types found in automated planning.
Our approach differs in two crucial ways.
Firstly it operates entirely on-the-fly, bypassing the expensive construction of
Rabin automata for the formulas and their prohibitive prior synchronisation with
the full state space of the SSP.
Secondly, it extends recent heuristic search algorithms and admissible
heuristics for cost-constrained SSPs, to enable pruning regions made infeasible
by the PLTL constraints.
We prove our algorithm correct and optimal, and demonstrate
encouraging scalability results.",
note = "Correction: The complexity result in Theorem 4 is incorrect. The
incorrectnes is based on an oversight in the use of a Tseitin-style CNF
transformation when progressing LTL formulas to the next state. A
correct progression-based algorithm, of higher complexity though,
employs standard CNF instead. The soundness theorem (Theorem 5), and
completeness theorem (Theorem 6) still apply with that correction.
Moreover, and importantly, it is such a correct version that we had
implemented and used in our experiments. The experimental results,
hence, are not affected by the incorrectnes, and neither are the other

    data-centric business processes and present a form of general
    model checking.  Our technique extends existing approaches, which
    explore systems only from concrete initial states.
    \par
    Specifically, we model business processes in terms of smaller
    fragments, whose possible interactions are constrained by
    first-order logic formulae.  In turn, process fragments are
    connected graphs annotated with instructions to modify data.
    Correctness properties concerning the evolution of data with
    respect to processes can be stated in a first-order
    branching-time logic over built-in theories, such as linear
    integer arithmetic, records and arrays.
    \par
    Solving general model checking problems over this logic is
    considerably harder than model checking when a concrete initial
    state is given.  To this end, we present a tableau procedure that
    reduces these model checking problems to first-order logic over
    arithmetic. The resulting proof obligations are passed on to
    appropriate ``off-the-shelf'' theorem provers.  We also detail our
    modelling approach, describe the reasoning components and report
    on first experiments.",

Recent years have seen considerable interest in procedures 
for computing finite models of first-order logic specifications. 
One of the major paradigms, MACE-style model building, is based
on reducing model search to a sequence of propositional
satisfiability problems and applying (efficient) SAT solvers 
to them.
A problem with this method is that it does not scale well 
because 
the propositional formulas to be considered may become very large. 
\par
We propose instead to reduce model search to a sequence 
of satisfiability problems consisting of function-free 
first-order clause sets, and to apply (efficient) theorem provers
capable of deciding such problems.
The main appeal of this method is that 
first-order clause sets grow more slowly than 
their propositional counterparts, 
thus allowing for more space efficient reasoning. 
\par
In this paper we describe our proposed reduction in detail
and discuss how it is integrated into the Darwin prover,
our implementation of the Model Evolution calculus.
The results are general, however, as our approach can be used 
in principle with any system that decides
the satisfiability of function-free first-order clause sets.
\par  
To demonstrate its practical feasibility, 
we tested our approach on all satisfiable problems from 
the TPTP library. 
Our methods can solve a significant subset of these problems,

The 
FDPLL calculus by Baumgartner was the first successful attempt

FDPLL lifts to the first-order case the core of the DPLL procedure,
the splitting rule,

although not necessary for completeness, 
are crucial for its effectiveness in practice.

In this paper,
we present a new calculus loosely based on FDPLL

In addition to being a more faithful litfing of the DPLL procedure,
the new calculus contains 
a more systematic treatment of {\em universal literals},
which are crucial to achieve efficiency in practice.
The new calculus has been implemented successfully
in the Darwin system, described elsewhere. 
The main results of this paper are theoretical,

                  version of the propositional DPLL procedure. The
                  main data structure of that calculus is the context,
                  which provides a compact representation of certain
                  Herbrand interpretations. The new calculus builds in
                  its core on a version of contexts modulo LIA. More

Blocking 
is based on a conceptually rather simple encoding together

This provides a general-purpose method for finding small models.
The presented techniques are implemented and have been successfully

  the ME calculus without equality. Like ME it maintains an explicit
  ``candidate model'', which is searched for by DPLL-style splitting.
  For equational reasoning MEE uses an adapted version of the ordered
  paramodulation inference rule, where equations used for
  paramodulation are drawn (only) from the candidate model. The
  calculus also features a generic, semantically justified
  simplification rule which covers many simplification techniques
  known from superposition-style theorem proving.  
  Our main result is the correctness of the MEE calculus in the
  presence of very general redundancy elimination criteria."

  knowledge representation applications like the {\em Semantic Web\/}.
  Automated reasoning support for these ontologies is mandatory for tasks
  like debugging, classifying or querying the knowledge bases, and description
  logic (DL) reasoners have been shown to be very effective for that.
  Yet, as language extensions beyond
  (decidable) DLs are being discussed, more general first-order logic systems
  are required, too. In this paper, we pursue this direction and
  consider automated reasoning on full first-order logic knowledge bases.
  We put forward an optimized approach of transforming such knowledge bases to
  clause logic. The transformations include a Brand-like
  transformation to eliminate equality, and a transformation that
  incorporates a {\em blocking\/} technique to ``checks loops'' in
  derivations.  The latter transformation lets theorem provers
  terminate more often on satisfiable input formulas. It thus enables
  more robust automated reasoning support on ontologies, where
  disproving is a common task.  While the transformations are
  applicable to any clause set, we concentrate in this paper on
  demonstrating their effectiveness on a standard test suite devised by
  the Semantic Web community.",

		  theory-reasoning versions of connection calculi are defined
		  and related to each other. In doing so, TME will be

		  theory reasoning system is only operable in combination
		  with an (efficient) background reasoner for the theories of
		  interest. Instead of hand-crafting respective background
		  reasoners, a more general approach --- linearizing
		  completion --- is proposed. Linearizing completion enables

		  Horn\/} clauses are enhanced with an interface to efficient
		  constraint solvers. The question arises whether it is
		  possible to incorporate constraint processing into general,
		  non-Horn theorem proving calculi. In this paper, a positive
		  answer to this question will be given. A framework for a
		  new calculus is introduced which combines model elimination
		  with constraint solving, following the lines of
		  B{\"u}rckert (1991). A prototype system has been
		  implemented rapidly by only combining a PROLOG technology
		  implementation of model elimination and PROLOG with
		  constraints. Some example studies, e.g. taxonomic
		  reasoning, show the advantages and some problems with this
		  procedure. ",
