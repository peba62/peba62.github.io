<h3>Areas of interest</h3>
<p>My area is <em>automated deduction (AD)</em>. AD is concerned with
push-button technology for logical reasoning on computer. AD systems
take as input a formula of a formal (mathematical) logical language,
such as propositional or first-order predicate logic, and apply
inference rules of a logical calculus to analyse the formula for its
properties
(see <a href="http://www.associatepublisher.com/e/a/au/automated_theorem_proving.htm">here</a>
and
 <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasoning-automated/">
here</a> for an overview of the area, and 
 <a href="http://www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/known-math/index/03-XX.html">here</a>
for mathematical logic more in general). Typically,
one is interested in determining whether the
formula is valid ("always true"), satisfiable ("sometimes true"),
under what conditions it is valid, whether it is valid in a fixed
interpretation ("model checking"), among others.

<p>Research in AD is highly specialized. My specific research interest
is the design of AD systems for first-order predicate logic and
applying them to solve real-world problems. I am interested in any
application area, such as program development and verification,
knowledge representation, in particular ontological reasoning, and,
more recently, business rules and process model analysis.

<!-- <p>I welcome students to work with me on (mostly) every topic that -->
<!-- fits in the above description. Below I describe possible projects, -->
<!-- which can be carried out towards a honors degree, a masters degreee, a -->
<!-- Ph.D. degree, a Summer Internship or a project in the Erasmus Mundus -->
<!-- EMCL program, as indicated. Concrete projects for Summer Research -->

<p>Below I describe two research areas that are of interest to me and that are
suitable for student projects. Please do not contact me if you are looking for
an internship and need financial support for that.

<h3>Instance-based methods</h3> 
Instance-based methods (IBMs) are a
family of methods for first-order logic theorem proving. IBMs share
the principle of carrying out proof search by maintaining a set of
instances of input formulas and analyzing it for satisfiability until
completion. IBMs are conceptually essentially different to other, more
mainstream, methods like resolution or free-variable analytic
tableaux. Also, IBMs exhibit a search space and termination behaviour
(in the satisfiable case) different from those methods, which makes
them attractive from a practical point of view as a complementary
method. For instance, IBMs are decision procedures for function-free
clause sets and thus capture the complexity class NEXPTIME.
My main interest here is advancing one such IBM, the so-called Model
Evolution calculus.
A brief overview paper on IBMs
is <a href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~baumgart/publications/IMoverview.pdf">here</a>. 

<p>Concrete topics are centered around improving Model Evolution.

<h3>Logical analysis of business rules and processes</h3>

<p>Business rules (BRs) are declarative statements that describe legal or
operational constraints of a business. Business process models (BPMs) descibe
execution of workflows. The interest here is to consider automated reasoning
techniques to analyze BRs and BPMs, for properties such as consistency,
redundancies and certain completeness properties, which helps to make sure
that BRs make sense. Another interest is reasoning about BRs and BPMs in
combination, in order to support compliance analysis and business process
execution planning. We envisage our approach is useful for both offline,
static analysis and during runtime, to determine possible next steps as
business processes are executed.

<p>For instance, we are looking into transforming BRs and BPMs into
first-order logic so that automated theorem provers can 
be used then. While this is a rather general and powerful approach, it comes
with several technical challenges that need to be addressed (termination,
scalability, e.g.). Concrete topics will be around these issues.
