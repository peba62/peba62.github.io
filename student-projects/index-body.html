<h2>Student Project Offers</h2>

<p>I am looking for honours, masters or PhD students that are interested in both
theory and practice of automated reasoning. The theory typically concerns the design of
a logic, its properties, and a calculus for it; the practice concerns the
implementation in a theorem prover and its application to some interesting
problem(s).</p>

<p>See
  <a href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au/research/student-research-projects/automated-reasoning-situational-awareness">this page</a>
for a concrete topic area on <em>Automated Reasoning for Situational Awareness</em>.
