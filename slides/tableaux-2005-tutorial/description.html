The term ``instance based methods'' (IBM) refers to a family of methods
for first-order logic theorem proving. IBMs share the principle of
carrying out proof search by maintaining a set of instances of input
clauses and analyzing it for satisfiability until completion. IBMs are
conceptually essentially different to well established methods like
resolution or free-variable analytic tableaux. Also, IBMs exhibit a
search space and termination behaviour (in the satisfiable case)
different from those methods, which makes them attractive from a
practical point of view as a complementary method. This observation is
also supported empirically by results obtained with the first serious
implementations available (carried out by Letz and Stenz, cf. the
system competitions (CASC) at CADE-18 and CADE-19).

<P>
The idea behind IBMs is already present in a rudimentary way in the
work by Davis, Putnam, Logemann and Loveland in the early sixties. The
contemporary stream of research on IBMs was initiated with the
Plaisted's Hyperlinking calculus in 1992. Since then, other methods
have been developed by Plaisted and his coworkers. Billon's
disconnection calculus was picked up by Letz and Stenz and has been
significantly developed further since then. New methods have also been
introduced by Hooker, Baumgartner and Tinelli, and more recently by
Ganzinger and Korovin.  The stream of publications over the last years
demonstrates a growing interest in IBMs. The ideas presented there
show that research on IBMs still is in the middle of development, and
that there is high potential further improvements and extensions like
equality and theory handling, which is currently investigated.

In the tutorial, we will cover the following topics:
Early IBMs, the common principle behind IBMs; 
classification of IBMs (one-level vs. two-level calculi),
comparison to resolution and free variable tableaux;
selected IBMs in greater detail: ordered semantic hyper linking,
the disconnection method, the model evolution calculus;
the completeness proof of one selected method; extension to equality
reasoning; implementation techniques, particularly the disconnection
method.

<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Peter Baumgartner</SPAN> has (co-)authored 13 journal articles, 32
conference or referred workshop papers, and five chapters in
books. Most publications are concerned with calculi, implementations
and applications of first-order logic automated deduction systems.
He developed a First-Order version FDPLL of the propositional
Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland procedure.  This method, and its
successor, the Model Evolution Calculus (jointly developed with
Cesare Tinelli) are his recent main contributions to instance based
methods. 

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Gernot Stenz</SPAN> has been directly involved in instance based theorem proving
for several years. He is the (co-)author of 12 scientific papers and system
descriptions at international conferences and some other publications in
journals and books. Nearly all of his more recent publications deal with
instance based theorem proving in general and the disconnection calculus in
particular. The implementation of theorem prover systems is among his
principal matters of interest, he was a co-author of the e-SETHEO prover
system, where his work also included automated learning methods for theorem
provers and he has been developing and improving the DCTP theorem prover
implementation of the disconnection calculus. Both of these systems have won
trophies at the annual CADE theorem prover competitions.
