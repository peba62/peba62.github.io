<h3>AIM</h3>
  
<p>This is a book of collected articles presenting research in all aspects of
  automated reasoning, in particular the design of automated reasoning
  systems and their applications.

<p>A common theme behind Mark Stickel's work was developing techniques for
  building better automated reasoning systems. His discoveries were
  ground-breaking and include AC-unification, reasoning modulo a theory, term
  indexing, and thorough development of the SNARK and PTTP provers. In 2002 he
  received the Herbrand award for all his work, the highest award in automated
  reasoning (See the <a href="http://www.cadeinc.org/">CADE</a> web page).

<p>We would like to honour Mark's achievements by editing a Festschrift
  comprised of articles in the spirit of his research approach: developing
  fundamental techniques driven by practical applications and informed by
  rigorous theory.

<h3>SCOPE</h3>
<p>We invite high-quality submissions on the general topic of
  automated reasoning and its applications, especially but not
  exclusively to the design of automated theorem proving systems, with
  connections to any of Mark Stickel's research areas:

<ul>
  <li>Automated theorem proving, including deductive and abductive reasoning</li>
  <li>Implementation of and practice with automated reasoners</li>
  <li>Algorithmics for automated reasoners: unification,
    matching, rewriting, indexing</li>
  <li>Integration of general-purpose reasoning with external procedures</li>
  <li>Spatial and temporal reasoning</li>
  <li>Inference control, theory reasoning, semantic guidance for automated reasoners</li>
  <li>Application of automated reasoners in mathematics,
    logic, program synthesis, natural language, and natural sciences</li>
  <li>SAT-solving</li>
  <li>Applications related to formal methods</li>
  </ul>

<h3>PUBLICATION DETAILS</h3>
<p>
  It is planned that the book will be published as an LNAI Festschrift
  with Springer.


<h3>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
<p>
  While it is expected that most of the papers will be regular
  technical papers, a few papers that combine scientific content
  with recollections of Mark Stickel's work and personality,
  as can be written by those who worked with him, are also sought.

<p>
  All papers will be refereed by anonymous peer reviewers, and
  read by the editors, according to the highest standards in terms
  of originality, significance, technical quality, and readability.

<p>
  Submissions must be in English and standard conforming pdf
  format. They must be unpublished and not submitted for
  publication elsewhere. However, significantly extended versions
  of papers published at conferences are welcome. Submissions
  of any length will be considered, but final versions may be
  limited by the editors depending on the totality of submissions.
  Authors are strongly encouraged to produce their papers in LaTeX.
  Formatting instructions and the LNCS style files can be obtained
 <a href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html">here</a>.
Electronic submission via EasyChair is open 
<a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=festschriftmarkstick">here</a>.

<p>
<b>EXTENDED SUBMISSION DEADLINE: March 24th, 2014</b>

<p>
  In order to facilitate the planning of the book, authors are
  invited to notify the editors as soon as possible of their
  intention to submit with proposed topic and length. Early
  submission would be especially helpful for completing the
  review process sooner.
