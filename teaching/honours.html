    <p>
Formal logic provides a mathematical foundation for many areas of
computer science. Logical languages are used as specification language
within, e.g., program development and verification, hardware design
and verification, relational databases, and many subfields of
Artificial Intelligence. Automated Deduction is concerned with the
design and implementation of algorithms based on logical deduction for
      solving problems in these areas.  <b>Instance Based Methods</b>
are a relatively new family of methods for Automated Deduction; they share
the principle of carrying out proof search by maintaining a set of
instances of input formulas and analyzing it for satisfiability until
completion.

    <p>I offer several research-oriented honours projects centered
    around Instance
Based Methods, in particular in connection (experimentation/extension)
with our own Darwin system (<A
